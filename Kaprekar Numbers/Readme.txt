A Kaprekar number is a number whose square when divided into two parts,
such that sum of parts is equal to the original number and none of the parts has value 0
An example of this is 45^2 = 2025 and thus 20 + 25 = 45.

The objective is to send two ints indicating the start and end search range
Should output the Kaprekar numbers in this range.
Firstly base 10 then futhering the challenge.
Ideally working on arbitrary bases.
